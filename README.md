20231119: The latest "OpenSolver for Google Sheets" code is accessible through the Google Scripts ecosystem at https://script.google.com/home

`save.pmc` is an [Pulover's Macro Creator](http://www.macrocreator.com/) script that copies all files from Google Script Editor into Sublime and saves them. Highly hardcoded to my desktop setup right now. Adjust the Loop repetitions to match the number of files in the project.
