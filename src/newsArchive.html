<p>Version 2.2.3 (released 6 January 2017) contains the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes NEOS connection error by using HTTPS for connections.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Version 2.2.2 (released 2 September 2016) contains the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes a "Cell Reference" bug in the linearity check.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Version 2.2.1 (released 25 July 2016) contains the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the solve is stopped early by the internal 6-minute time limit in Google Sheets, it will now automatically resume instead of waiting for the Solve button to be clicked again.</li>
  <li>The incomplete model that is used for resuming is now saved on a new hidden sheet to allow models larger than 100 KB to be saved.</li>
  <li>A bug where the costs were not loading correctly when resuming the solve has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Error messages now contain the stack trace for better debugging.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, please see the <a href="http://opensolver.org/opensolver-for-google-sheets-v2-2-1/">release post</a> for this release.</p>

<p>Version 2.2.0 (released 18 April 2016) contains the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added support for early stopping in GLPK. If your problem is taking a while to solve and you are satisfied with the quality of the best solution that has been found so far, you can stop the solve and OpenSolver will load this solution into the sheet. To stop a solve early, just click the "Cancel solve and use current best solution" button.</li>
  <li>When solving a "Target Objective" problem, we now try to minimize the deviation from the target rather than making the target a hard constraint. Previously, if the target was hard or impossible to reach, the solver may have taken a long time to finish. Coupled with the early stopping in GLPK, you can now stop the solve early if the solution is close enough to your desired target.
</ul>

<p>For more information, please see the <a href="http://opensolver.org/opensolver-for-google-sheets-v2-2-0/">release post</a> for this release.</p>

<p>Version 2.1.0 (released 15 April 2016) contains the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added GLPK solver. You can now solve problems in your browser using the open-source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/">GLPK</a> solver, via <a href="https://github.com/hgourvest/glpk.js">glpk.js</a> by Henri Gourvest. This solver runs in the browser on your computer rather than on a cloud server, so is typically much faster than the alternatives and we heavily recommend choosing it in place of Cbc via NEOS.</li>
  <li>Linearity check occurs before solving to catch non-linearities before spending time solving the model.
  <li>Bugfixes:
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug where dialogs could time out before they finished loading.</li>
    <li>Fixed sheet-scoping issue when storing constraints</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<b>NOTE:</b> Google have fixed the bug in the LinearOptimizationService and so the Google Linear Solver should now be functional again.

<hr>

<p>Version 2.0.0 (released 7 April 2016) contains the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for one more than one model per workbook! Now, each sheet can have its own model. Use the sheet selector at the top of the sidebar to switch to the model for a sheet.</li>
  <li>Models can reference cells on different sheets! You can define models using ranges on any sheet in the workbook.</li>
  <li>Added a new solver: Cbc on NEOS! You can choose to either use the solver provided by Google, or the <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc">Cbc solver</a> on the <a href="https://neos-server.org">NEOS optimization cloud</a>. Note that all problems submitted to NEOS become publicly available, please see the <a href="https://neos-server.org/neos/termofuse.html">terms of use</a>.</li>
  <li>Support for resuming incomplete solves! If the solve takes more than 6 minutes, it will be stopped before a solution is found. Now you can resume the solve from where you left off, allowing you to solve larger models than before.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Due to supporting one model per sheet, we have had to make changes to how we store the OpenSolver models, and so your current models are not automatically loaded into the new version. To load in your old model, you can either redefine it manually, or use the "Import previous model" item in the menu. This will load in your previous model as the model for the currently selected sheet.</p>
